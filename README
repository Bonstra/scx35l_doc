This document is an effort to document the SC9830I SoC from the SharkLS SCX35L
family from Spreadtrum.

The information in this document comes only from public sources, such as the
GPL'd source code, datasheets from other chips using the same IP blocks, and
experimentation on real hardware.

The document is written in the txt2tags format (https://txt2tags.org/). You
can build the HTML version by installing txt2tags and running:

$ txt2tags scx35l_doc.t2t

This will generate the scx35l_doc.html file.

If you also have GNU make installed, you can also simply run:

$ make

It will re-generate the c2000doc.html file only if one of the .t2t files has
changed since the HTML was generated.
